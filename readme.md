# Laravel Homestead customizations

An after.sh file for a Homestead v2 installation. You'll need to put this in your ~/.homestead directory

The official Homestead documentation [is located here](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead?version=4.2).


You can find the old customized Homestead v1 in the v1-branch.
